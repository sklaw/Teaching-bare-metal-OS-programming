# Teaching Bare-Metal OS Programming

- I use this repository to organize the four lab projects I designed and implemented for the lab sections of an operating system course at UMD.

- Through these projects, students gained hands-on experience in:
  - Implementing priority-based scheduling ([link to project](https://github.com/sklaw/circle/tree/master/sample/43-ENEE447Project1))
  - Implementing ARM context switching and preemptive multitasking ([link to project](https://github.com/sklaw/circle/tree/project2/sample/44-ENEE447Project2))
  - Combining cooperative and preemptive multitasking, as well as identifying and protecting critical regions ([link to project](https://github.com/sklaw/circle/tree/project3/sample/45-ENEE447Project3))
  - Creating and handling system calls, and loading and executing code from isolated virtual memory spaces ([link to project](https://github.com/sklaw/circle/tree/project4/sample/46-ENEE447Project4))
